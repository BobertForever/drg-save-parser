DRG Save Parser is a rust-based save file parser for Deep Rock Galactic, published
as a WASM library to NPM. It was made specifically for use in [DRG Completionist](https://github.com/BobertForever/drg-completionist).

## Special Thanks

- [@robertnunn](https://github.com/robertnunn) for their work on [DRG-Save-Editor](https://github.com/robertnunn/DRG-Save-Editor) that helped us get us started on our save parser
- The helpful folks on the _DRG Community Tools_ Discord server, who always helped us out with our questions
- The couple Ghost Ship Games devs who got us pointed in the right direction with save file stuff early on

## Disclaimer

Neither this app nor its developers are associated with Deep Rock Galactic or Ghost Ship Games in any way whatsoever. _(But we really admire what they do.)_
